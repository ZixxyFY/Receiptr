# Receiptr App: Receipt Persistence and Pie Chart Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Receipt Storage Issue
**Problem**: Receipts were not being stored persistently. The app was using in-memory storage that was lost when the app was closed.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented Room database for persistent local storage
- Created `ReceiptEntity` for database storage
- Added `ReceiptDao` with CRUD operations
- Updated `ReceiptRepositoryImpl` to use Room database
- Added database conversion methods (`toEntity()` and `toDomain()`)

### 2. Data Visualization Enhancement
**Problem**: The analytics screen only showed repeated bar charts without pie chart representation.

**Solution**:
- Created a custom `PieChart` composable with animated drawing
- Added `PieChartData` model for chart data
- Implemented `CategoryPieChart` function for category spending visualization
- Added pie chart alongside existing bar chart in analytics screen

## Key Features Implemented

### Persistent Receipt Storage:
- ✅ Receipts are now saved to local SQLite database via Room
- ✅ Data persists between app sessions
- ✅ Automatic cloud sync with Firestore (when available)
- ✅ Offline functionality maintained
- ✅ Search functionality works with database
- ✅ CRUD operations fully implemented

### Pie Chart Visualization:
- ✅ Animated pie chart with smooth transitions
- ✅ Category-based spending breakdown
- ✅ Color-coded legend with percentages
- ✅ Empty state handling
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Material Design 3 styling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema:
- Receipts table with proper indexing
- Type converters for complex data types (lists)
- Foreign key relationships maintained
- Proper data normalization

### UI Components:
- Custom Canvas drawing for pie chart
- Animation using Compose Animation APIs
- Reusable components with proper state management
- Accessibility considerations

### Testing:
- Unit tests for data layer
- Component tests for UI elements
- Conversion function tests
- Mock-based testing approach

## Usage Instructions

### For Receipt Storage:
1. Receipts are automatically saved to local database when created
2. Data persists between app restarts
3. Cloud sync happens in background when internet is available
4. Search and filter functions work with persistent data

### For Pie Chart:
1. Navigate to Analytics/Insights screen
2. Scroll down to see both bar chart and pie chart
3. Pie chart shows category distribution of spending
4. Legend shows percentages and amounts for each category
5. Chart animates when loaded for better user experience

## Build and Test Status
- ✅ All builds successful
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Lint checks passed

## Future Enhancements
- Add export functionality for chart data
- Implement chart interaction (tap to highlight)
- Add time-based filtering for pie chart
- Include budget tracking visualization
- Add more chart types (line charts, stacked bars)
